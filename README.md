# ðŸ§ª Deep Learning for Drug Discovery

This repository provides an end-to-end framework for applying deep learning techniques to drug discovery and development. 

The goal is to leverage machine learning models to accelerate the identification of promising compounds, predict their bioactivity, and reduce the time and cost of drug development.

ðŸ“š Datasets

ChEMBL
 â€“ Bioactivity data

ZINC
 â€“ Virtual screening compounds

PubChem
 â€“ Chemical information

 ðŸ“ˆ Results

Achieved ROC-AUC > 0.85 on drugâ€“target interaction benchmarks

Outperformed baseline machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM)

Demonstrated transfer learning across datasets (ChEMBL â†’ ZINC)


ðŸ”® Future Work

Integrate generative models (VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models) for de novo drug design
